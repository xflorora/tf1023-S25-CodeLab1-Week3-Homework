SAVE FILES

Putting a short description of my game idea here as I haven't yet:

  The idea for my game is the player gets to make their own poem by collecting scrolls. Some scrolls are required to collect in order to pass through the levels ("Soul Scrolls"), while others differ in mood and tone and are signified by their color. Players can choose which colored-scrolls to follow by going into respectively colored portals that lead to different levels. For example, the "Seeing Red" scrolls will be representative of anger, etc. At the end of the game, the player will have a personalized poem based on which scrolls they decided to collect.

Continuing off of the previous weeks' work, I tried to have two different score counters in my game: the "base" score ("Soul Scrolls") and, to start, one variant ("Seeing Red") scrolls. Rather than have a high score, I tried to convert the high score counter we made in class into a "Total Scrolls" counter. Although I succeeded in doing so, I was unable to save the total number of scrolls collected to an external text file. The file was created through code, but the saved score remains at zero.
